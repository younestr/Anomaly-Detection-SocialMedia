Margins came back clear, however, I have been quite anxious since all this went down. My husband no longer wants to hear me cry about it, but I truthfully cannot talk about my experience without choking up. I have constant anxiety about dying, about falling asleep and not waking up. I am a new mom to a beautiful 1 year old boy, and the thought of getting cancer again and not being around for him destroys me. I have been in therapy for a long while, but I feel I need more support from other melanoma survivors. I am desperate for encouragement and positive stories."

It was only 2.5weeks after starting immunotherapy when he had the CT (Dr ordered it due to blood shot eyes). The CT showed 6 Mets not sure if they are completely new or old ones growing again as he originally had 8 plus one at the back of his eye. Anyways, because the one behind his eye didn’t come back he is suspecting the immunotherapy is working on the rest of his body but is unable to get past the blood Brian barrier. He wants to commence whole Brian radiation for 3 weeks Monday-Friday. He said radiation in conjunction with immunotherapy can increase the likelihood  of breaking down those blood Brian barrier issues. My question is, how can he tell after 2.5weeks that immunotherapy can’t get through the blood Brian barrier is there not more time we can give that to happen ? Also, had anyone had this happen and radiation helped breaking it down to let it work? Also, what’s the most brain Mets someone has had targeted radiation on as he seems adamant WBR is the way forward? We are meeting our medical oncologist tomorrow so will know more as well. He is back on targeted therapy in the mean time. ❤️🙏"

I have an appointment to go back in and get the area excised. My question is, they didn’t mention anything about it spreading to lymph nodes or having to remove lymph nodes for testing. Is that normal in advanced stage? Also, is it normal to get this done by a dermatologist? The nurse who called seemed to be trying to make it not a big deal, but I’m worried. I’m going to call back tomorrow to ask some more questions because I was at work when she called and really caught off guard and don’t 100% remember what she said about size. I just don’t know what to expect with this so any information would be so appreciated."

I no longer have daily panic attacks and crippling depression. I don’t go to the doctor every other week and am kind of “living my life” again. I want to have another child.

I also have no cancer gene mutations. That provided immense relief for a time but now I feel I need more proof I don’t have cancer like a full body MRI or $950 blood test. I can’t even afford that. I want to have another child and move on and be happy but I’m so scared I’ll be tempting fate and not counting the blessings I have. I’m only 26.

I (21F) was diagnosed with a melanoma on my left knee today. A shave biopsy was done and found that the mole was 0.8mm and cancerous. I’m meeting with a surgical oncologist to discuss surgery so he can take margins and make sure it didn’t spread to my lymph nodes.

My husband m73 has stage iv melanoma with brain metastases in the frontal temporal lobes (which affect his executive functioning and short term memory). He has been through immunotherapy, SRS and has been on targeted therapy for three months. His last PET scan showed great progress with just some small residual cancer in his lymph nodes and brain metastases, while still present, have stopped growing. Things are moving in a positive direction right?! At our last oncologist appoint husband was complaining of the intense fatigue he was experiencing so his onc suggested cutting his dose of the targeted therapy drugs in half to see if it has any effect. We agree and go on our way. Now my husband claims I’m sabotaging his treatment and insists that I give him all of the pills he should be taking. He claims that it’s the targeted therapy drugs that are giving him energy and he needs to take them all. We are due to check in with the onc on how his reduced dosage is working in about two weeks and it seems like a waste of time for us to go to the onc if my husband isn’t taking the reduced dose. How long should I accommodate his misunderstanding of what the doctor is recommending?  He claims that the doctor never said to cut the dose and I must be making it up. I’m thinking to contact the doctor and ask them whether to postpone the appointment. Thanks for reading"
