Our neighborhood has many mature versions, so I‚Äôve never seen a small tree like this to compare. The bark looks interesting, like lots of suckers over time, not as smooth as I expected for a lacebark elm. It also seems more like a ‚Äúlollipop‚Äù than I expected. The leaves also aren‚Äôt turning yellow (I was told this is a standard variety which I expected to have some leaf loss). We‚Äôre in zone 10a."

Not completely sure it is rot,but I think it might be. Don‚Äôt know why almost all my desert plants are rotting in their native soil. Also I did fertilize this tree as soon as I moved it. Hope I can save it!"
