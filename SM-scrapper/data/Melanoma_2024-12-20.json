Margins came back clear, however, I have been quite anxious since all this went down. My husband no longer wants to hear me cry about it, but I truthfully cannot talk about my experience without choking up. I have constant anxiety about dying, about falling asleep and not waking up. I am a new mom to a beautiful 1 year old boy, and the thought of getting cancer again and not being around for him destroys me. I have been in therapy for a long while, but I feel I need more support from other melanoma survivors. I am desperate for encouragement and positive stories."

I honestly haven\u2019t felt super stressed about melanoma since, but I am suddenly so overwhelmed after my skin check appointment today. During the appt, I had 3 moles removed, one of which had a slightly pinkish hue like the one that was cancerous 2 years ago. This biopsy site is also bleeding a LOT more than the other two. The depth of the shave, biopsy location, etc could obviously play a role, but I can\u2019t help but worry that this is a sign of malignancy. I won\u2019t know for sure until my biopsy results but just curious if anyone has noticed heavier bleeding being associated with a melanoma diagnosis??"

It was only 2.5weeks after starting immunotherapy when he had the CT (Dr ordered it due to blood shot eyes). The CT showed 6 Mets not sure if they are completely new or old ones growing again as he originally had 8 plus one at the back of his eye. Anyways, because the one behind his eye didn\u2019t come back he is suspecting the immunotherapy is working on the rest of his body but is unable to get past the blood Brian barrier. He wants to commence whole Brian radiation for 3 weeks Monday-Friday. He said radiation in conjunction with immunotherapy can increase the likelihood  of breaking down those blood Brian barrier issues. My question is, how can he tell after 2.5weeks that immunotherapy can\u2019t get through the blood Brian barrier is there not more time we can give that to happen ? Also, had anyone had this happen and radiation helped breaking it down to let it work? Also, what\u2019s the most brain Mets someone has had targeted radiation on as he seems adamant WBR is the way forward? We are meeting our medical oncologist tomorrow so will know more as well. He is back on targeted therapy in the mean time. \u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\ude4f"

He is BRAF + and started targeted therapy to control Brian Mets for one month then they made the switch to immunotherapy. He had 9 Brian Mets but had an almost complete response to targeted therapy. He had immunotherapy 2.5weeks ago and had a CT scan yesterday that\u2019s showed disease progression, the oncologist  over the phone said more lesions and bigger so god knows how many now. She has stopped immunotherapy now and back on targeted therapy for a week to get back on top of them. My question is does this mean he is not suited to immunotherapy. I don\u2019t know how they will ever be able to switch him with how aggressive and fast growing his tumours seem to be. Is there any hope for us? She wants to see us Tue and asked him to have his family around as well I\u2019m terrified she will say we have no other options. Any works of hope are appreciated we have a 3.5yr old and a 8m old so this is devastating \u2764\ufe0f\ud83e\udd1e"

I am having surgery in a few weeks to ensure that all of it was removed.  The doctors suggested doing a sentinel node biopsy as well and are leaving the decision up to me.  Based on a lot of the information online that I\u2019ve been reading the prerequisites for having this additional sentinel lymph node biopsy may not be needed.  Just trying to get some opinions or other experience people have had that may have had a similar diagnosis.  I did have an additional biopsy done which came back at roughly 4.5-5% chance that melanoma has a chance of spreading to be in my lymph nodes.  One thing that\u2019s in the back of my mind if reading about complications of lymphedema after the procedure so I\u2019m hesitant to have it done when the percentages and information I\u2019ve been reading are pretty low.  Below is some information based on the biopsy done that may provide some information related to my situation.  Based on the biopsy below it was estimated around 7%, a different biopsy which I'm not exactly sure of the name but was told it was based off of Australian data/research it was 4.5-5%.  Is regular skin checks sufficient or is a sentinel node biopsy suggested/needed?"

I have an appointment to go back in and get the area excised. My question is, they didn\u2019t mention anything about it spreading to lymph nodes or having to remove lymph nodes for testing. Is that normal in advanced stage? Also, is it normal to get this done by a dermatologist? The nurse who called seemed to be trying to make it not a big deal, but I\u2019m worried. I\u2019m going to call back tomorrow to ask some more questions because I was at work when she called and really caught off guard and don\u2019t 100% remember what she said about size. I just don\u2019t know what to expect with this so any information would be so appreciated."

My husband m73 has stage iv melanoma with brain metastases in the frontal temporal lobes (which affect his executive functioning and short term memory). He has been through immunotherapy, SRS and has been on targeted therapy for three months. His last PET scan showed great progress with just some small residual cancer in his lymph nodes and brain metastases, while still present, have stopped growing. Things are moving in a positive direction right?! At our last oncologist appoint husband was complaining of the intense fatigue he was experiencing so his onc suggested cutting his dose of the targeted therapy drugs in half to see if it has any effect. We agree and go on our way. Now my husband claims I\u2019m sabotaging his treatment and insists that I give him all of the pills he should be taking. He claims that it\u2019s the targeted therapy drugs that are giving him energy and he needs to take them all. We are due to check in with the onc on how his reduced dosage is working in about two weeks and it seems like a waste of time for us to go to the onc if my husband isn\u2019t taking the reduced dose. How long should I accommodate his misunderstanding of what the doctor is recommending?  He claims that the doctor never said to cut the dose and I must be making it up. I\u2019m thinking to contact the doctor and ask them whether to postpone the appointment. Thanks for reading"
